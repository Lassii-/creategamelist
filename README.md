 # MAME Tools

Tools I've created to manage my MAME ROM-collection. These are written with Linux in mind so they won't work on Windows.

## Current tools
* Creategamelist
    * Creates an alphabetically sorted list of the current MAME ROMs so when upgrading to a newer collection it's easy to filter unwanted games out.
