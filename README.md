 # Game Collection Tools

Tools I've created to manage my ROM-collection. These are written with Linux in mind so they won't work on Windows for now.

## Current tools
* creategamelist
    * Creates an alphabetically sorted list of the ROMs so when upgrading to a newer collection it's easy to filter unwanted games out. Supports multiple different platforms and asks for which you want to create the list for.
* filtergames
	* move games listed in the textfile created by creategamelist to a directory called result under the rom-directory
