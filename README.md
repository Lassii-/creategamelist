 # MAME Tools

Tools I've created to manage my MAME ROM-collection. These are written with Linux in mind so they won't work on Windows for now.

## Current tools
* creategamelist
    * Creates an alphabetically sorted list of the current MAME ROMs so when upgrading to a newer collection it's easy to filter unwanted games out.
* filtergames
	* move games listed in the textfile created by creategamelist to a directory called result under the rom-directory
